          after a year of intense virtual gazing, we, as the mava 328 typography
          studio class, zoomed in on our professorsâ€™ faces and explored how we
          can depict them with type. <br />
          <br /> the result is "typortraits": an exhibition, a labor of love and
          the culmination of all that we have learned.
          <br />
          <br /> enjoy seeing the many beloved faces of our faculty in a
          different light! <br />
          <br />
          we hope to continue our exhibition next year, on our campus and
          face-to-face.
